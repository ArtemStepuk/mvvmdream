## Motivation

Just yet another one MVVM example with cross platform implementation, unit tests and ui tests.

## Installation

Currently project is using Carthage and Pods as dependency managers (pods decommissioning is in plan). Everything is in the repository. So in theory nothing has to be done, just checkout/build/run.

Dependencies are:

 - RxSwift/RxCocoa
 - Swinject
 - FBSnapshotTestCase (for iosAppTests target)
